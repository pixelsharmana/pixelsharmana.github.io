<h1>Letters from a tiny war</h1>

<p><i>Dearest Mother</i></p>
<p>I hope you get this letter. Reception is extremely sporadic, and land-Pingers<a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a> are rare. Wouldn't be surprised if most of them are scrap by now.</p>

<p>I write this by dying flashlight, if you can call it writing. The mud seeps through my fingers as I scribble. Do not weep for me yet. Though why should you wait? The earth here is so hungry it might swallow these words whole before they find you.</p>

<p>The trenches are a nightmare even the Patulvians wouldn't dare to dream. We sleep in graves, our own holes, and wake to rotting flesh and the wet crunch of boots on what's left of men we laughed with yesterday. Amelion, do you remember him? The bioreactor worker from Vale's End who sang <i>Valiant Fighters</i><a href="#footnote-2">[2]</a> off-key every evening? He's gone. His faceâ€¦ never mind. Words fail here.</p>

<p>The artillery never stops. It's not noise anymore. Men beg to be shot in the head rather than listen to that sound another minute. They're right. Yesterday, the captain stood three paces from me, quoting Midas III like we were still at some ridiculous officers' ball. Then a shell came and that was it. I have his watch in my pocket. It makes a horrible sound. I think something inside is broken. I removed its battery.</p>

<p>They say we fight for Alferstia, for glory, for our nation. Glory is the mud caked to our teeth. Our nation? I saw a complerate<a href="#footnote-4">[3]</a> today, his PBA<a href="#footnote-4">[4]</a> melted by fire, and asked him why this hell exists. He stared into my eyes and said nothing, not even a warning or anything. Loyalty to the nation is as dead here as the men stacked like cordwood in front of the lines.</p>

<p>Every morning, they count us. The numbers shrink, but the orders never do: "<i>Forward, forward!</i>" Toward what? A hill that isn't worth a single breath of this poisoned air? They tell me we've advanced fifty meters these last two months. Fifty meters of hell for one hundred sixty-three thousand lives.</p>

<p>I survive by accident alone. A laser missed me by a hair, probably because the shooter coughed mid-sight. Another time, I stepped over... something. The guy just after me blew up. Luck, mom. That's all. The rest are gone. Levian, the boy who drew in his notebook. Elte, the historian who swore he'd his memories about this place and not leave anything out. All gone. Not even graves.</p>

<p>Here, the rats are fat on human hands and the "songs" are screams that linger like smoke. I've stopped crying. Even my anger is numb. The war grinds on because it can. Because they send more boys to chew up in its gears. What's left of me? A ghost who breathes and shoots and prays for the next shell to find me. Why live when all I see is the end, multiplied by thousands?</p>

<p>Forgive me if this mail never reaches you. Delete it if it does. The world beyond these trenches no longer exists. Not as we knew it. It was a lie they told us before they sent us into this meat-grinder.</p>

<p>I love you, but love is another word for foolishness now.</p>

<p>Your son (or whatever shadow remains),</p>

<p>P.S. If you receive this, send no reply. The post stops when everyone dies, and that day grows closer every dawn.</p>

<p><i>Mom,</i></p>

<p>If this scrap finds you, delete it before the words pierce your soul. I write between waves, between the living and the dead, and what's left is a hollow thing that breathes. They sent more boys today. Fresh faces. Younger. Their eyes still hold light enough to break my heart.</p>

<p>They marched in singing <i>Valiant Fighters</i>, their uniforms crisp as wedding gowns, their rifles gleaming like promises. By dusk, the song was choked into silence by mud and blood. Now they're just parts. A hand here, a boot there, with eyes still open. The light was gone though. "Good riddance" I heard myself think. I felt pity once. Now it's only disdain.</p>

<p>The officers called them "reinforcements." What mockery. All just meat for this machine. The ground itself is full of bones now. Craters filled with the rotting remains of men who believed in something. Even the rats are starving; there's nothing left to eat but each other.</p>

<p>Today, a boy no older than Levian (rip) came to me trembling. He'd just turned 17. His mother packed him a loaf of bread with her kisses on it, he said. I showed him where Amelion fell. A craterlike any other. By dawn, his body was in the same crater. The bread tasted fine, but I couldn't finish it. It made me vomit.</p>

<p>We don't advance anymore. We rot. They tell us to hold this line, and that's it. The trenches are rivers of filth now; the rain mixes with guts and shit. Even the rain is stained red on good days. Brown on bad ones. I've forgotten what blue skies look like.</p>

<p>The artillery isn't loud anymore. It's just a constant drum beneath our skulls. Last night, a shell hit the dugout where the new recruits slept They never even knew combat. First day here, what luck. For them as for us. We consider them buried; there aren't enough hands left to give them a 'proper' burial, whatever that means now. There's no stench at least, which is the best news I've heard in months.</p>

<p>The officers? Dead. Replaced by boys who don't know how to die yet, let alone lead anyone. Patriotism is gone, just survival instincts and a scream lodged in the throat of everyone here. We joke about dying first so someone else takes our guard shift. Some take the joke too far, if you see what I mean.</p>

<p>They say we're fighting for Alferstia. We're not even in the sub-sector. We're just invading for cheap ressources. For Alferstia? Please, enough. I don't even care about the SP<a href="#footnote-5">[5]</a>, no matter what we say, we'll die soon.</p>

<p>I've stopped counting days. Time means nothing here; we're all already ghosts. The only measure is the pile of corpses outside. How many layers thick they become each morning. The one in front of me is 30 corpses deep, 7 corpses high. I think it spans around two hundred meters. Not sure.</p>

<p>If you read this, know that I am done believing in luck. It was a lie too, like everything else. The next shell will find me soon enough. Let it be quick. The pain cannot be worse than what I've already seen.</p>

<p>Forgive me for fading without saying goodbye. We don't get to choose how we end here. We're just footnotes in a war that writes its own epitaphs in blood.</p>

<p><i>Mom,</i></p>

<p>This world is dying, and we are its undertakers. The rain has turned to ice. It sticks to our rifles like tears on a corpse's face. My boots split open yesterday; the leather rots where my feet once were. We're all skeletons in rags here. Even the rats are too weak to gnaw bones anymore.</p>

<p>The medic hung himself three days ago. Found him by his cot. He'd tied the wire so tight around his neck it snapped his tongue loose into his mouth. Now the sick and wounded rot with us. The complerate? Left a month past, muttering about "Alvegrian madness." They say he was last seen crawling toward Seetian lines, singing chants backward like some mad iron penitent.</p>

<p>Our officers are worse than ghosts. Captain Moreau sits in the corner of his dugout, clutching a rusted spoon and humming children's nursery rhymes. When asked for orders, he just stares at his hands until we leave. The second lieutenant who took his place? He ordered five men to drag that... thing out of no-man's land.</p>

<p>You remember Jelean, the boy from Marilan who collected coins in a tin cup? He tried stealing a dead Seetian officer's watch chain. Said it was for money for his sister. Crawled halfway though no-man's land, frozen and desperate. Got stuck in barbed wire like some grotesque ornament. Now he hangs there still, arms clawing at the strands, his face swelling black under the ice. The lieutenant sent two squads to retrieve him. Both were cut down by Seetian snipers who took the shots as if hunting some sport. The body is still there like a rotting flagpole. Flies don't even feast on it in this cold. Sometimes the wind blows the smell there. I want to kill myself.</p>

<p>And the children. Little boys with voices too high to sound Alferstian yet. Twelve-year-olds, I'm not kidding, shoved into uniforms that drown them. One of them asked me today when he'll go home. I told him soon. Now he's gone too. His leg blown off so clean you'd think it was a surgeon's work. But you already know he hung himself, so there.</p>

<p>Equipment? The guns jam in the frost; lasers are louder too. Snaps the very air like twigs. Last night, I dropped my rifle. It shattered into three pieces just from hitting dirt. We're fighting with bayonets scavenged from graves now. They've stopped issuing coats; instead they give us warmth in the form of disposable iron flake pouches. The heat ring is dead by the way.</p>

<p>I don't write to you anymore. There's nothing left worth saying except goodbye. Every morning, I count my breaths like a dying man counting coins. Eighteen thousand today. Nineteen thousand tomorrow?</p>

<p>The Seetian shot a stretcher-bearer yesterday. Watched him fall, screaming for his mother. They laughed as he choked on his own blood. Here's a secret, mom. I shot him something like two hours after. Not out of mercy. I wanted him to shut up.</p>

<p>Maybe you'll find my body someday. A frozen thing with a face that never knew peace again. Tell Lamark's sister that shit is all we're owed. She's understand.</p>

<p>Your son,</p>

<p>P.S. They say we're "winning massive advances." Lies. We haven't moved in three months.
