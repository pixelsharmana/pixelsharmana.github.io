<h1>Letters from a tiny war</h1>
<p>I hope you get this letter. Reception is extremely sporadic, and land-Pingers<a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a> are rare. Wouldn't be surprised if most of them are scrap by now.</p>

<p>I write this by dying flashlight, if you can call it writing. The mud seeps through my fingers as I scribble. Do not weep for me yet. Though why should you wait? The earth here is so hungry it might swallow these words whole before they find you.</p>

<p>The trenches are a nightmare even the Patulvians wouldn't dare to dream. We sleep in graves, our own holes, and wake to rotting flesh and the wet crunch of boots on what's left of men we laughed with yesterday. Amelion, do you remember him? The bioreactor worker from Vale's End who sang Valiant Fighters<a href="#footnote-2">[2]</a> off-key every evening? He's gone. His faceâ€¦ never mind. Words fail here.</p>

<p>The artillery never stops. It's not noise anymore. Men beg to be shot in the head rather than listen to that sound another minute. They're right. Yesterday, the captain stood three paces from me, quoting Midas III like we were still at some ridiculous officers' ball. Then a shell came and that was it. I have his watch in my pocket. It makes a horrible sound. I think something inside is broken. I removed its battery.</p>

<p>They say we fight for Alferstia, for glory, for our nation. Glory is the mud caked to our teeth. Our nation? I saw a complerate<a href="#footnote-4">[3]</a> today, his PBA<a href="#footnote-4">[4]</a> melted by fire, and asked him why this hell exists. He stared into my eyes and said nothing, not even a warning or anything. Loyalty to the nation is as dead here as the men stacked like cordwood in front of the lines.</p>

<p>Every morning, they count us. The numbers shrink, but the orders never do: "Forward, forward!" Toward what? A hill that isn't worth a single breath of this poisoned air? They tell me we've advanced fifty meters these last two months. Fifty meters of hell for one hundred sixty-three thousand lives.</p>

<p>I survive by accident alone. A laser missed me by a hair, probably because the shooter coughed mid-sight. Another time, I stepped over... something. The guy just after me blew up. Luck, mom. That's all. The rest are gone. Levian, the boy who drew in his notebook. Elte, the historian who swore he'd his memories about this place and not leave anything out. All gone. Not even graves.</p>

<p>Here, the rats are fat on human hands and the "songs" are screams that linger like smoke. I've stopped crying. Even my anger is numb. The war grinds on because it can. Because they send more boys to chew up in its gears. What's left of me? A ghost who breathes and shoots and prays for the next shell to find me. Why live when all I see is the end, multiplied by thousands?</p>

<p>Forgive me if this mail never reaches you. Delete it if it does. The world beyond these trenches no longer exists. Not as we knew it. It was a lie they told us before they sent us into this meat-grinder.</p>

<p>I love you, but love is another word for foolishness now.</p>

<p>Your son (or whatever shadow remains),</p>
<p>Heliont</p>
