<h1>The Nectar Lance</h1>

<p>Far away from the major trade routes and powerful empires, on a forgotten planet, two men of uncertain allegiance sat at a small campfire, watching the flames dance in the night sky. The younger man, Kyle, gazed at his companion with a look of curiosity. "Tell me, Jalubel," he said, addressing his friend who had spent years exploring the harsh and dangerous worlds of Sector ZF-C56. "What was the most powerful artifact you've ever found on your travels?"</p>

<p>Jalubel, a seasoned mage with a weathered face and tired eyes, took a long drink from his flask before answering. "That's a tough question, my friend," he began, his voice carrying a hint of nostalgia. "I've found many powerful artifacts over the years, but none as amusing as- well, it was a lance. Not much bigger than a walking stick. Simply looking at it, you'd say it was made of a quite simple metal. Dark grey, red tip. But when you pointed it at anything and activated it..." He paused for dramatic effect. "Everything turned into delicious, gooey nectar. I mean, anything." Jalubel chuckled at the memory. "I used it to sweeten my morning porridge for months with it. Those were the days."</p>

<p>Kaine's eyes widened with both amazement and disbelief. "Anything?" he asked, leaning forward. "That's incredible."</p>

<p>The mage grinned, clearly enjoying the memory. "Yes. Incredibly powerful. When pointed at anything and activated, it turned its target into nectar. I found it in a ruined temple that had been abandoned for centuries on some world, near the Gulf of Dion."</p>

<p>His friend laughed, shaking his head. "That sounds more like a gag gift than a weapon of power. How did you use it?"</p>

<p>The mage leaned back in his chair, a faraway look in his eyes. "Oh, it was incredibly useful. I once found myself facing cultists in a forest once. I pointed the lance at a falling tree and turned it into nectar before it crushed me." He chuckled at the memory. "Another time, I was blocked by a stone door in a dungeon. One zap and it became a sticky puddle. No more door."</p>

<p>Kyle was smiling widely, picturing the absurd situations. "I can't believe you carried around a weapon that turned things into goo. What about shield spells or wards?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it simply went through all of that. Magic, technology - nothing could stand in its way. A triple aegis couldn't stop it." He shook his head. "The mage I was fighting turned into nectar."</p>

<p>"But what kind of enchantment could pierce such defenses? Are you sure you're not pulling my leg?" Kyle asked, now dubious of the whole story.</p>

<p>"Trust me, I'm not pulling your leg. I did cast a whole slew of information spells on it, but..." He shrugged. "No dice. I couldn't tell you how it worked."</p>

<p>"That's incredible. But surely there must have been a way to determine its origin, or..."</p>

<p>Jalubel sighed, shaking his head. "I tried, believe me. But as far as I could tell, the lance just turned... well, everything into nectar. It was like it was made by a bored god who thought the universe needed more sugar."</p>

<p>Kyle looked at him with skepticism. "Right, so what did you do with it? Where is it?"</p>

<p>The mage's face suddenly turned grave, all mirth vanishing from his features. He leaned forward, his voice taking on a somber quality. "We had just turned someone's aeronef into nectar, and one of my companions was still cramped over laughing. I will never forget his next words. 'What would happen if we pointed it at the sun?' he asked, barely breathing from laughter." The mage's eyes seemed to look far away, as if gazing into the past. "I took it and had it melted down later that day." He shook his head, his face still grim. "I'm not even sure I want to think about what would have happened if we had actually done it."</p>

<p>"You destroyed something that powerful?" Kyle exclaimed, his words tinged with awe, disbelief and outrage. "I can't believe you just got rid of it! I would have at least tried to study it more."</p>

<p>The mage's face was unyielding. "Some powers are too dangerous to play with, Kyle. Sometimes you have to know when to quit."</p>
